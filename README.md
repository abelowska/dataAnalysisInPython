2. [The art of reading and searching](https://github.com/abelowska/dataPy/blob/main/Classes_02_Reading.ipynb): Exercises in reading documentation and finding solutions to problems based on work with the Pandas library.
3. [Linear Regression](https://github.com/abelowska/dataPy/blob/main/Classes_03_Linear_Regression.ipynb): Exercises in linear regression: estimating linear relationships between variables; loss functions; testing predictive power of models.
4. [Linear Regression: data transformation](https://github.com/abelowska/dataPy/blob/main/Classes_04_Linear_Regression.ipynb): Exercises in interpreting model's parameters in the context of data; data transformations and scaling.
5. [Non-linear Regression: K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees](https://github.com/abelowska/dataPy/blob/main/Classes_05_KNN_DT.ipynb): Exercises in KNN and DT; important models' parameters; stability of KNN and DT.
6. [Classification with K-Nearest Neighbors and Decision Trees](https://github.com/abelowska/dataPy/blob/main/Classes_06_KNN_DT_Classification.ipynb): Exercises in KNN- and DT-based classification.
